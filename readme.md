# Welcome to the Bridge between Rekordbox, Pro DJ Link via Beat Link Trigger and Python

## Aim of the project is to build a bridge from what is now playing on a Pro DJ Link device

### Technology

- Rekordbox 7.0 from AlphaTheta (formerlery known as Pioneer DJ)
- Pro DJ Link enabled Hardware (XDJ-XZ, RB-DMX-1)
- 3rd Party Software (Beat Link Trigger from Deep Symmetry)
- UDP as protocol from clojures driven BLT to Python
- Python scripts to bring the data from BLT via UDP into an UI

### Motivation

For years i like to play my favorite songs with Rekordbox, installed on my Mac.
I own some controllers like the DDJ 800, RB-DMX-1, DDJ-XP2 und the XDJ-XZ as standalone player.
Played around with different solution to get my lighting in sync of the playing song.

### Idea

My idea is to bring that together by using Pro DJ Link in combination with Deep Symmetry's
great solution Beat Link Trigger and python
